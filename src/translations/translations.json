I'm heartbroken\n    for local brick-and-mortar retailers, who are facing sudden hardship as\n    people are encouraged to stay indoors for safety.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    At Shopify, we're\n    <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/covid19\" target=\"_blank\"\n      >acting quickly to respond</a\n    >\n    with product updates and new offers to help retailers like you navigate\n    these challenging times. We‚Äôll announce more changes soon. Right now, local\n    businesses need to find creative new ways to stay engaged with their\n    customers, even while their retail location is unavailable.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I created this tutorial to help you quickly set up an online store, so your\n    customers can buy online and safely pick up their products curbside.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <strong>Note</strong>: This guide is for businesses that are brand new to\n    Shopify.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>How it works</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    Curbside pickup allows customers nearby to buy something online and drive by\n    your storefront or your ‚Äúcurb‚Äù to pick it up‚Äîwithout ever having to leave\n    their car. This ‚Äúdrive-through‚Äù option is often more convenient and it can\n    reduce shipping costs and minimize person-to-person interactions. Here are\n    the steps:\n  </p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      Your customer will order and pay you online through your new online store\n    </li>\n    <li>You‚Äôll get the order emailed to you, so you can prepare it safely</li>\n    <li>You‚Äôll then tell the customer when it‚Äôs ready for pickup</li>\n    <li>Your customer will drive to your store and pop their trunk</li>\n    <li>You‚Äôll safely place their order in their trunk</li>\n    <li>That‚Äôs it, you're done!</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h2>Steps to set up a \"buy online, pickup curbside\" experience</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    I've made this tutorial with the goal of getting your store up and running\n    within 10 minutes to an hour, depending on how many products you upload.\n    Let's begin!\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>1. Before you begin selling</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Before you can start selling products online, it's helpful to have the\n    following items ready:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Photos of your retail store. </strong></li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Logos or brand assets </strong>for your retail business. If you\n      need a logo made quickly, try\n      <a href=\"https://hatchful.shopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hatchful</a>.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Short product descriptions</strong> that describe your products\n      and why people should buy. If you need help writing descriptions,\n      <a\n        href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/8211159-9-simple-ways-to-write-product-descriptions-that-sell\"\n        >read our guide</a\n      >.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Product photos</strong> to showcase your catalog. You can take\n      quality photos with most modern phones.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>2. Start your online store</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The first step is to head over to\n    <a\n      href=\"http://shopify.com\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\n      >Shopify‚Äôs homepage</a\n    >\n    and start your 90-day free trial. Your store name will become your domain,\n    or the URL that your customers will go to when they want to order from your\n    store.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In this tutorial, the URL I‚Äôm using is katiescafecurbside.myshopify.com for\n    my business, Katie‚Äôs Cafe. You can buy a\n    <a\n      href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/domains/add-a-domain\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >custom domain</a\n    >\n    later, but it‚Äôs not necessary for launching your store.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Learn more</strong>:\n    <a\n      href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/intro-to-shopify/initial-setup/goals-checklist\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >Checklist to set up your online store</a\n    >\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>3. Add products</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    You can add products in a few ways, but to quickly create a ‚Äúbuy online,\n    pick up curbside‚Äù experience, I recommend the following steps:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      From your Shopify admin, head to\n      <strong>Products &gt; All products. </strong>From this page, click the\n      button <strong>Add product. </strong>Enter a title for your product, along\n      with a product description and photo.\n    </li>\n    <li>Make sure to select <strong>Track inventory </strong></li>\n    <li>\n      Since you won‚Äôt be doing any shipping, uncheck\n      <strong>This is a physical product </strong>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Make sure to edit variants if your item has more than one option (e.g.\n      different sizes, colors, etc.)\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <div class=\"note\"></div>\n    <p>\n      <strong>üí° Tip:</strong> Keep your online store simple by only adding only\n      your best-selling products or ‚Äúessentials‚Äù and keep current demand in\n      mind. Fewer products will reduce your setup time and get your business\n      back up and running faster.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Learn more: </strong\n    ><a\n      href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/add-update-products\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >Adding and updating products in Shopify</a\n    >\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>4. Customize your theme</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The theme you choose should reflect your business‚Äì‚Äìthink of it as your\n    digital storefront. You can choose one of the\n    <a\n      href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/themes-by-shopify\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >free themes we offer</a\n    >\n    or explore the\n    <a href=\"https://themes.shopify.com/designers/shopify\" target=\"_blank\"\n      >theme store</a\n    >\n    for more options.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Your online store uses a default theme, Debut, to display content. I kept\n    the Debut theme for this tutorial.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>After you choose a theme, you can customize it to fit your brand.</p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      Go to <strong>Themes </strong>then click the\n      <strong>Customize </strong>button to edit the homepage of your online\n      store.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Edit the theme's default sections using the theme editor. Select\n      <strong>Image with text overlay </strong>and\n      <strong>Text column with images. </strong>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Click the remaining sections and click the\n      <strong>Remove section </strong>button. Alternatively, you can simply hide\n      them by clicking on the eye icon.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Select <strong>Image with text overlay. </strong>This section on your\n      website introduces your store to your customers. Add a photo of your\n      business and customize the heading and text. You can see how my store\n      looks below.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Include a button with a call to action. Select\n      <strong>All products </strong>as the<strong> Button</strong\n      ><strong>link</strong> so customers can start shopping immediately.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/1_284679f9-00d0-4e03-bf31-107e29197773.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144464\"\n    /><br />Now, head back to your theme editor. Configure\n    <strong>Text columns with images</strong> to include more details. For my\n    store, I‚Äôm using this section to explain to my customers how curbside pickup\n    works.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After that, return once again to your theme editor. Now select\n    <strong>Header </strong>to edit the top of your website. This is a great\n    place to add your logo. You can see what my logo looks like in the example\n    below.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/2_2bd6d3ca-7330-4ca7-8848-d37a89bf6b1a.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144509\"\n    /><br /><br /><strong>Learn more: </strong\n    ><a href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes\" target=\"_blank\"\n      >Themes for your online store</a\n    >\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>5. Customize your product pages</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Now it's time to set up basic product pages to showcase your products. Head\n    to the drop down menu at the top of your screen and select\n    <strong>Product pages. </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <br /><img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/3_33b6782a-c958-4dae-81c8-885ee0fa42eb.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144535\"\n    /><br /><br />\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Select <strong>Show quantity selector </strong>to allow your customers to\n    choose as many of each item as they want. After that, select\n    <strong>Show variant labels</strong> [why]\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    The last step for your product pages is to unselect\n    <strong>Show dynamic checkout button.</strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Note</strong>: Dynamic checkout accelerates the purchase by skipping\n    the cart and completing the payment with the checkout method displayed on\n    the button. The button dynamically changes to reflect the customer's\n    preferred accelerated checkout method. Since you‚Äôll need to add customers‚Äô\n    license plate information at checkout, you don‚Äôt want to offer dynamic\n    checkout button.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <br /><img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/unnamed_3b1da8a5-f70f-461b-a3bf-96fe7c5afac6.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144564\"\n    />\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>6. Customize your shopping cart page</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    The shopping cart page is where customers can view all of the items they've\n    added to their cart, or the products they intend to purchase. We'll want to\n    make some quick changes to set up our \"buy online, pickup curbside\"\n    experience.\n  </p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>In your drop down menu at the top, go to Cart</li>\n    <li>In the left panel, select Cart page</li>\n    <li>\n      Select both <strong>Enable automatic cart updates </strong>and\n      <strong>Enable cart notes. </strong>We need the cart notes so that\n      customers can add their license plate.\n    </li>\n    <li>In the left panel, select <strong>Theme settings</strong></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>\n    <br /><img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/5_f3c4836c-c243-4f19-be5e-6bcc463ebee1.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144684\"\n    /><br />The next step is to head back to your admin homepage and select\n    <strong>Sales Channels &gt; Themes</strong>. On the right side, where you\n    see <strong>Current theme</strong>, click on\n    <strong>Actions &gt; Edit languages</strong>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/6_39b96101-99b4-4197-aa7a-f7cf59a1fd65.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144727\"\n    />\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In the field titled <strong>Note, </strong>add the following instructions:\n    ‚ÄúPlease indicate your license plate number and car make or model‚Äù\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/7_6b026e6b-2d09-4d3f-832f-4d28afcc3978.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144757\"\n    />\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Finally, consider playing around with your theme settings. If you have\n    social media, I‚Äôd add it now. Here's how:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Go to Online store &gt; Themes and click the Customize button</li>\n    <li>\n      In the left panel, you‚Äôll see <strong>Social media.</strong> Select and\n      add the URLs for your social media accounts\n    </li>\n    <li>Consider using your logo as the <strong>Favicon</strong></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/8_8e7d8f16-aed1-43d4-a8ea-caff647f017c.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144781\"\n    /><br />None of this is required, but it helps make your site look more\n    professional and customized to your business.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>7. Customize your emails</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    Nice work, you're almost ready to go! Let‚Äôs configure the emails your\n    customers will receive from you after they complete their order. These\n    notification emails will let your customers know when it‚Äôs time to come pick\n    up their order.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    To begin, make your way to <strong>Settings</strong> and select\n    <strong>Notification emails &gt; Order confirmation. </strong>This is the\n    default email that customers will receive when they place their order.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/9_ebefa99a-9af6-4b71-a62c-b2d7a55eb128.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144813\"\n    /><br />In the <strong>Email body (HTML) </strong>you‚Äôre going to edit a\n    little bit of code. Don‚Äôt worry, I'll walk you through each step.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Let's begin by selecting the following text from the body of the email‚Äîand\n    only this portion!‚Äî and then deleting it:\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded\">\n    {% capture email_title %}Thank you for your purchase! {% endcapture %} {%\n    capture email_body %} {% if requires_shipping %} Hi {{ customer.first_name\n    }}, we're getting your order ready to be shipped. We will notify you when it\n    has been sent. {% endif %} {% endcapture %}\n  </div>\n\n  <p>\n    Once you've deleted the snippet above, the text box should look like this\n    now:\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/10_11aa9d8b-90c1-4143-b8ca-881893800cee.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585144984\"\n    />\n  </p>\n\n  <p>In the second line of the email body, paste in this copy:</p>\n\n  <div class=\"marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded\">\n    {% capture email_body %} Hi {{ customer.first_name }}, thanks so much for\n    your order! We're getting your order ready for pickup. We will notify you by\n    email when it is ready for pickup! {% endcapture %}\n  </div>\n\n  <p>After you've done that, this is what you should see:</p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/11_1469cc64-2b19-44f3-a7d2-71d6b1be0795.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585145045\"\n    /><br /><br />\n  </p>\n\n  <p>Preview the email to make sure you‚Äôre happy with how it looks.</p>\n\n  <p>\n    Now, go back to the notifications list to edit another email template called\n    <strong>Shipping confirmation.</strong> This is the email you‚Äôll send\n    customers when their order is ready.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Start by deleting this code from the <strong>Email body (HTML):</strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <br /><em\n      ><img\n        alt=\"\"\n        src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/12_6ee37263-6633-4acf-a0bb-770748635e39.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585145080\"\n    /></em>\n  </p>\n  <p>In the first line of the email, paste the following copy:</p>\n  <div class=\"marketing-block marketing-block--light marketing-block--padded\">\n    {% capture email_body %} Hi {{ customer.first_name }}, thanks so much for\n    your order! It‚Äôs now ready for pickup. Please head to our storefront and pop\n    your trunk. We‚Äôll check your license plate and put your order in the trunk!\n    {% endcapture %}\n  </div>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>\n    Then, update your Subject line to read: ‚ÄúYour order from {{ name }} is ready\n    for curbside pickup!‚Äù\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>8. Launch your store</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    You can do everything above in Shopify before you pick your plan. Once\n    you're ready to go live, it's time to choose the right plan for you. The\n    <strong>Basic Shopify </strong>plan is likely all you need to offer a \"buy\n    online, pickup curbside\" experience for your customers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once you select a plan, you‚Äôll be prompted for payment information but you\n    won‚Äôt be charged until your 90-day trial is up.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/13.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585145162\"\n    /><br /><br /><br />\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Go back to your Online Store and <strong>Disable password</strong>. Once you\n    hit save, your online store will be live!\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>9. Accept orders</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    When you get an order, you‚Äôll receive an email from Shopify to the email\n    address you signed up with. You can also log back into Shopify at\n    <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.shopify.com</a> to\n    check your orders at any time. Orders will show up in the\n    <strong>Orders</strong> section of your Shopify admin.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/14.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585145185\"\n    /><br /><br />\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Once an order is ready for pickup, capture the payment and then select\n    <strong>Mark as fulfilled</strong>. This will capture payment from a\n    customer's credit card, and send the customer an email notifying them that\n    their order is ready for pickup.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/15_f45ad879-3bf7-4c9b-8ef3-56cc4eff4538.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585145204\"\n    /><br /><br />Next, in the <strong>Summary</strong>, press the\n    <strong>Fulfill items </strong>button. I recommend tagging the order as\n    ‚Äúready‚Äù. This way, when you search for ‚Äúready‚Äù in your orderspage search\n    bar, all of your ready orders will populate so that you can find and view\n    them easily.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    On each of the ready orders, you can find the license plate in the\n    <strong>Notes </strong>section on your right panel.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <img\n      alt=\"\"\n      src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/6_35b506c1-2afb-4121-8c21-ad5c8df08043.png?format=webp&amp;v=1585145234\"\n    />\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Lastly, remove your ‚Äúready‚Äù tag once you‚Äôve delivered to your customer‚Äôs\n    trunk.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>10. Accept payments</h3>\n\n  <p>\n    All Shopify-supported payment methods rely on third-party providers to\n    process your transactions. These providers might charge extra fees, as well\n    as enforce rules about what products you can sell using their service. When\n    you set up a payment method, check with the company providing the service to\n    make sure you understand their rules and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Follow these instructions to\n    <a\n      href=\"https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/getting-paid\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      >make sure you‚Äôre set up to get paid</a\n    >.\n  </p>\n  <p><br /><br /></p>\n\n  <h2>Ways to enhance your online store</h2>\n\n  <p>\n    With your Shopify store now live and available to customers, there are a few\n    other steps you can consider to improve their shopping experience.\n  </p>\n  \n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Sell gift cards,</strong> which can help free up cash flow.
